MOAR REFERENCES on WHY SCALA:

- uniquely supports MODERN APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF DATA very FAST

- language foundation for what could arguably be considered the "Killer App" of the decade:   SPARK
  which supports machine learning/data science for BIG and FAST data processing so that businesses can ADAPT to
  changing conditions very FAST

- BROAD industry applications include:
  - Movie and Music recommendations
  - Election Polls voter segmentation and sentiment
  - Utility usage patterns based on smart thermostat or water faucet sensor feedback
  - Cancer genomics
  - Olympic Training
  - Neuroscience and Nuerofeedback for training the brain within 2 sigma 'healthy' patterns
  - triggering people to buy more stuff on Amazon

// TODO: go over SCALABILITY vs PERFORMANCE
- "The terms PERFORMANCE and SCALABILITY are commonly used interchangeably,
but the two are distinct: performance measures the speed with which a single request can be executed,
while scalability measures the ability of a request to maintain its performance under increasing load.
For example, the performance of a request may be reported as generating a valid response within three seconds,
but the scalability of the request measures the requestâ€™s ability to maintain that three-second response time as
the user load increases."

Quoting Werner Vogels from this post "Why is scalability so hard? Because scalability cannot be an after-thought.
