Thoughts on these bullet points:

- Writing software is:

  the confines of what is practical. Like the golden gate 
  bridge was designed to be beautiful, but serve a practical purpose.

  - social

  Software is built by teams working together, so you have comraderie and can make
  friends. But on the other hand you must deal with personalities and prejudice.

- Writing Scala is:
  - fun
       
  Scala is enjoyable to use. It is concise way to express ideas. You can get quick feedback in
  the "REPL" and "Worksheet." You can build something then see it work (or not), which
  is satisfying.

  intellectual exploration, growth, and learning.

  A lot of opportunity exists today to get a job as a Scala programmer, and the
  the market for Scala programmers seems to be growing strongly.

   in which newcomers can explore and learn.
