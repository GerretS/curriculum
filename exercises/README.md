Exercises
--------

Exercises are designed to be small programming challenges that could be completed in the [Scala REPL](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/repl/overview.html)

Idea: Lemonade stand game

The game is to figure what is the sweet (and sour) spot where
the player will make the most money at your lemonade stand.

The player has so much money at the beginning. They can choose how many
lemons and sugar to buy. Water is free.
The heat of the day will influence the demand, on the hottest day people
are most elastic. (The game can use historical weather data. Maybe player
can set the city.) The player can set the price and can tweak
the lemonade recipe.

Can have individual exercises like koans that each create one
method that will later be used in an exercise that combines them,
so you show composability of functions. Can show that as we go
actually.

Then at the end, students can play the lemonade game using their
own code.
